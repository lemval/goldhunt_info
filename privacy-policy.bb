[font size="4"][b]ADDITIONAL INFORMATION[/b][/font]

As per required, part of the usage policy is also the explaination of why and how certain Android capabilities and permissions are used.

[b][font size="3" color="#1f6dc5"]Which permissions does the Application use?[/font][/b]

[b]Notification of new geocaches[/b]

The notification process runs following your given profile during certain times. As you want to be notified as soon as events happen (namely the new publication of a geocache), a number of permissions are required.

Access to the user its [b]location on the background[/b] is needed to be alerted of new publications in your vicinity. You do not care about new publications of geocaches if they are out of your reach. Therefore the Application collects the location, both while actively using the application as well as when you currently not using your phone, in order to let you know, based on your preferences, when and how you are notified.

To make sure you are notified timely, we use [b]notifications[/b], [b]exact alarms[/b] and [b]wake[/b] the device.

[b]Visualizing and navigation[/b]

A [b]fine location[/b] based on GPS signals supports showing geocaches on route, in the vicinity (on the map and in the list view) and allows you to navigate to a certain geocache.

For routes, the OpenStreetMap library is used. For navigation, the Application looks for available options and presents those to the user.

[b]Basic functionality[/b]

For retrieving information from Groundspeak, Inc., the Application uses data traffic over the [b]network[/b].

To allow making backups, store images of geocaches, import or export GPX files, [b]access to storage[/b] is requested. Not granting the permission will restrict the use of this functionality.
