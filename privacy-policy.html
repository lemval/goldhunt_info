<h1>PRIVACY POLICY</h1>
<p>This privacy policy governs your use of the software application named 'GoldHunt' in both
    the unpaid as well as paid version (further referred as "Application"). The Application was
    created by Lemval Software ("We", "Us") and is meant for the Geocaching activity by means of
    searching and showing geocaches of Groundspeak&#8482;, newly published or otherwise.
</p>

<p>The Application can be found in the store under
    <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=nl.lemval.goldhunt">
        GoldHunt Pro (Geocaching)
    </a>
    and under
    <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=nl.lemval.goldhunt.free">
        GoldHunt (Geocaching)
    </a>
</p>

<h2 style="color: #003399">What information does the Application obtain and how is it used?</h2>

    avatar, configured location and profile picture with the sole purpose of a correct working
    application.</p>

<h3>Automatically Collected Information</h3>

<p>In addition, the Application may collect certain information automatically, including, but not
    limited to, the type of mobile device you use, your mobile operating system, and information
    about the way you use the Application.<br/>
    However, Automatically Collected Information is in no way used by Us or the Application other
    than by explicit opt-in user consent via manually triggered feedback by mail.</p>

<h2 style="color: #003399">Which data is stored by the Application?</h2>

<p>The Application stores personal information, including set preferences, not yet submitted
    geocache visit registrations, Groundspeak profile data, locations (also as part of application
    logging), lists and drafts from Geocaching.com, and user statistics from Geocaching.com.<br/>
    The Application stores non-personal information for the purpose of the functionality, including
    map tiles, geocaches, custom waypoints, puzzle codes, and images associated with geocaches.</p>

<p>No data is stored by the Application on devices other than on which the Application is installed.
    Any data stored will, unless explicitly exported or transmitted by the user, be removed from the
    device upon clearing application data.</p>

<h2 style="color: #003399">Does the Application collect precise real time location information of the device?</h2>

<p>When you use the Application, We use GPS technology (or other similar technology) to determine
    your current location in order to (1) display your location on the map, to (2) search for
    new caches on Geocaching.com around your current location, and to (3) support navigation and
    routing to a geocache. We will not share your current location with other users or partners
    otherwise. If you do not want the Application to use your location for the purposes set forth
    above, you should not grant or revoke the location permission to the Application all together,
    or disable individual services in the application.

<h2 style="color: #003399">Do third parties see and/or have access to information obtained by the Application?</h2>

<p>We will only share information with third parties in the ways that are described in this
    privacy statement. No advertisement services are used. </p>

<p>We may disclose User Provided and Automatically Collected Information in the following conditions:</p>
<ul>
    <li>as required by law, such as to comply with a subpoena, or similar legal process;</li>
    <li>when We believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, protect
        your safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud, or respond to a government request;</li>
    <li>to Groundspeak, Inc. via behaviour through API calls (read about their <a href="https://www.geocaching.com/policies/en/privacy-policy">privacy statement</a>);</li>
    <li>to Google, by means of using the Android platform (read about their <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy">privacy statement</a>).</li>
</ul>

    third parties, even for purposes of Analytics or Advertisement.</p>

    Application. You may use the standard uninstall processes as may be available as part of your
    mobile device or via the mobile application marketplace or network.</p>

<h2 style="color: #003399">Data Retention Policy, Managing Your Information</h2>

<p>The Application will retain User Provided Data for as long as you use the Application. If youâ€™d
    like to delete User Provided Data that you have provided via the Application, please remove the
    Application. Please note that some or all of the User Provided Data may be required in order
    for the Application to function properly.</p>

<h2 style="color: #003399">Children</h2>

<p>We do not use the Application to knowingly solicit data from or market to children, regardless
    of their age. However, the unpaid version does advertise buying the single purchase full
    version and as set forth by the rules of Groundspeak, Inc. the Application will abide to
    showing the option to go for a Premium membership for Groundspeak members with Basic membership
    (read about their <a href="https://www.geocaching.com/policies/en/privacy-policy">privacy
        statement</a>).</p>

<h2 style="color: #003399">Security</h2>

<p>We are concerned about safeguarding the confidentiality of your information. We provide
    safeguards to protect information the Application processes and maintains. Please be aware
    that, although we endeavour providing reasonable security for your information, no security
    system can prevent all potential security breaches.</p>

<h2 style="color: #003399">Changes</h2>

<p>This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time for any reason. We will notify you of
    any changes to our Privacy Policy by posting the new Privacy Policy here and on the
    <a href="https://goldhunt.freeforums.net/thread/6/privacy-policy">forum</a>. You are advised
    to consult this Privacy Policy regularly for any changes, as continued use is deemed approval
    of all changes.</p>

<h2 style="color: #003399">Your Consent</h2>
<p>By using the Application, you are consenting to our processing of your information as set forth
    in this Privacy Policy now and as amended by Us. "Processing" means using cookies on a
    computer/hand held device or using or touching information in any way, including, but not
    limited to, collecting, storing, deleting, using, combining and disclosing information,
    all of which activities will take place on your own device.</p>

<h2 style="color: #003399">Contact Us</h2>

    about our practices, please contact us via the forum (https://goldhunt.freeforums.net/) or via mail (nlgeocaching on gmail).</p>

<h1>ADDITIONAL INFORMATION</h1>

<p>As per required, part of the usage policy is also the explaination of why and how certain
    Android capabilities and permissions are used.</p>

<h2 style="color: #003399">Which permissions does the Application use?</h2>

<h3>Notification of new geocaches</h3>

<p>The notification process runs following your given profile during certain times. As you
    want to be notified as soon as events happen (namely the new publication of a geocache),
    a number of permissions are required.</p>

<p>Access to the user its <strong>location on the background</strong> is needed to be alerted of
    new publications in your vicinity. You do not care about new publications of geocaches if they
    are out of your reach. Therefore the Application collects the location, both while actively
    using the application as well as when you currently not using your phone, in order to let you
    know, based on your preferences, when and how you are notified.</p>

<p>To make sure you are notified timely, we use <strong>notifications, exact alarms</strong> and
    <strong>wake</strong> the device.</p>

<h3>Visualizing and navigation</h3>

<p>A <strong>fine location</strong> based on GPS signals supports showing geocaches on route, in
    the vicinity (on the map and in the list view) and allows you to navigate to a certain
    geocache.</p>

<p>For routes, the OpenStreetMap library is used. For navigation, the Application looks for
    available options and presents those to the user.</p>

<h3>Basic functionality</h3>

<p>For retrieving information from Groundspeak, Inc., the Application uses data traffic over the
    <strong>network</strong>.</p>

<p>To allow making backups, store images of geocaches, import or export GPX files,
    <strong>access to storage</strong> is requested. Not granting the permission will
    restrict the use of this functionality.</p>
